# Games Codes

## Hands on Javascript by programming simple video games 

Decided to have a quick look on Javascript and I did that with a tutorial form **FreeCodeCamp**. At that time I was bored so I sad *"why not do some JS ?"*:
- I have compleated *Rock/Scissors/Paper Game* and *Memory Game*
- Added some extra Css to make them more stylish + some premade animations 
- JS Algorithms can be defined "super basic", I followed the Beginner guide

⚡All the games work properly, and that is a goal for me⚡
